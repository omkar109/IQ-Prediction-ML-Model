# IQ-Prediction-ML-Model
This is an extremely basic ML model used to predict IQ scores from GPA using tensorflow. The dataset used to train this model is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuchhbhi/cpga-iq-placement?resource=download. Overall this model ended up with a really high loss, presumably because GPA is not a good indicator of IQ scores.
